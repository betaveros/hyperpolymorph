# Hyperpolymorph

A flexible multi-language cheat sheet based on hyperpolyglot.org

## Why?

- Sometimes, I want to compare languages that are on different sheets, like Python and JavaScript, or in completely different paradigms, like Python and Haskell and C++. It's not easy to do this with hyperpolyglot.org.
- There are mistakes on hyperpolyglot.org which I've noticed but can't fix.
- I wanted an excuse to try out [Parsec](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Parsec).

## Running

Parsing HTML files from hyperpolyglot.org into text files requires BeautifulSoup. Parsing the text files back into one HTML file requires Parsec.

## License

The content of the cheat sheets themselves are licensed under [CC BY-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/), as per hyperpolyglot.org.

Note: I can't figure out who to attribute; I remember being able to peek at the history page of hyperpolyglot.org and seeing a username, which maybe starts with "W", but I can't find it now. If you know who, please let me know!

The scripts for parsing files and producing the HTML are released under the MIT license.

Still very much a WIP.
